 may I come in sir 
 yes come in 
 good afternoon sir good afterno afternoon ma'am good afternoon sir 
 please be seated thank you sir 
 
 sir my name is Kunal rogi I was born in LNO utar Pradesh but I was brought up in aala tripura post that sir I uh entered into bits plan plan campus and have been pursuing civil engineering and graduated in 2021 post add I'm trying to convert my dream into reality of becoming a civil servant uh meanwhile I was also working at topper education limited where I was teaching physics to class 11 and 12 students 
 
 why did you not go for the campus placement after passing out from uh bit bani 
 sir while making my long-term career option after during college sir I I felt that I wanted to join civil services which uh could help me serve the society as well as get job security and satisfaction and for that sir I decided to skip the campus placement in favor of preparing for the Civil Service you didn't go for the campus placement at all I did okay so you have opted for psir isn't it yes sir why a civil engineer should out for a subject like PSI sir during uh Choosing My optional subject sir civil engineering was there but perhaps I Al uh but perhaps when I was making the decision there were few other factors that I had to keep in mind first was the manageability of the syllabus second was regarding the time frame that I had and sir also in my college level I pursued some Humanity electives where I got to know about political science and international relations and so I also had a hobby in that so I decided to opt for psir for my uh optional sir so it's a fascinating subject for you now yes sir isn't it yes sir okay then why have you not opted for ifs as your first preference the state chose to join Indian administrative service sir I feel that political science in international relations also has the political science part where it is based with Administration and governance and there I thought that Indian administrative service could also help me pursue my passion sir explain to me you said you were born at LNO isn't it yes sir and brought up in uhal aala why so uh sir my father belongs to Indian Police Service from from tripura cada so my formative years of life was spent in tripura okay your father is in the IPS yes serving state of tripura and uh what is your preference IPS preference in the list sir third option sir third option why why have you kept it so low sir uh the Indian Police Service was obviously fascinating for me but again uh in feeling of the preferences there were few other factors in mind so career progression and my personal inclination was perhaps the most important thing and since I am interested in international relations I felt that I'm better suited temperament wise for Indian Foreign Service and administrator okay must have seen your father working in the police department from very close quarters sir what are the problems faced by the police particularly at the cutting a level so can I take a few sure sir firstly that I could first thing that I could think of is the overburdened police force whereby the sanction post is around 184 and according to un standard is 2 22 but for Indian police it is only 142 sir so there is a huge uh Personnel Gap sir second sir I think is the facilities in terms of policing sir so still the technological intervention has not taken place and many things are done manually which takes a lot of time for the police U people and Sir the third issue that I face is the mental health of police Personnel sir so there has been an increasing trend of fracti side as well as disciplinary issues because of the simple fact that police being over burden they do not have the time to meet their families and all and so they are very under pressure and things should be done to improve their uh Lifestyles from the citizens perspective you tell me why people are they rather fear to go to the police station to fire to Lodge an F particularly women sir I think the colonial mentality ingrained the term of police force rather than Police Service and since a large element of uh force is inculcated in the police mentality people are quite afraid and second of all sir the accountability uh is also as substandard Sir even after the procing Judgment of 2006 various police accountability commissions have neither taken place and if they have taken place the extractive and ex actionable accountability is not present at the ground level so people fear that if they go to the police station they may be harassed so they decide not to go at all what do you mean by zero f so zero f means that you can file uh your case at any police station regardless of its jurisdiction and then it would be transferred to the appropriate police station for further inquiries and investigation thank you thank you sir Kunal ma'am recently uh up convened um Kashi Tamil suum right yes ma'am so uh why such kind of uh uh you know SS or such kind of um events are required in India ma' I think India is a perfect culmination of unity and diversity but it needs to be shown at the ground level as well and that's where such sus make it reality whereby people from South India get to see and explore the various traditions of North India and vice versa so this basically strengthens the composite culture that is also mentioned in our constitution or is it because South Indian people are not so friendly towards North Indian people or vice versa ma'am personally I've never seen such thing I think uh the Ganga of aat culture is ingrained within each and every Indian Citizen and I don't see any reason why there is such apprehension shat ma'am how do you see it ma'am it's a positive idiom that perfectly summarizes what our historical and cultural Roots signify that we are unity in diversity okay but uh since we are having diverse culture so is it possible to uh you know you know include all culture and develop a kind of of uh resilience towards all culture accepting their language accepting their values is it happening today yes ma'am it is happening I think when a bat sh bat does not mean that we have a homogenizing culture that all people follow the same things but it means that the fundamental core values that describe what in Indian is that is what is a bhat sh Bharat that basically means celebration of diversity acceptance and tolerance of various cultures and promoting them rather than not celebrating them so that is what a bhat sh tries to convey great so what is your take on uh bhat or India popularizing the two terms yes would you favor for bat or you'll go for India M I think article one perfectly uh rest the debate it is India that is bhat and they could be used interchangeably ma'am so then why uh bhat instead of India what it signifies ma'am it uh India was the name that was given based on synu River okay and the Greeks attributed this name So currently under the punch FR principle we are trying to decolonize our minds and India somewhere people see that it is a past of the past relics bhat ma'am is an indigenous word that could be traced to either the araa or the jism culture where bhat was the first king so uh by trying to decolonize our minds we also need to decolonize our vocabulary and that's where the word bhat comes into the play okay uh Kunal uh you have studied psir ma'am you are an engineer so I may be wrong is that power charms you that's why you are coming into civil services no ma'am I don't think power has a capacity to charm people but that does not mean that people automatically get Charmed I think the basic values that I learned during my college days or for that matter when I was in national service scheme is that the ultimate happiness that one gets is not when it he has power but he's able to use whatever capacity he has in delivering happiness to other people and that's where civil services comes to mind okay so power has to empower yes ma' any thinker you can site from your subject who has actually spoken in power it can be Western thinker also uh Robert Dalal is there okay uh Michael Fuko is there what Fuko says fuk has a relatively different uh stand on power uh ma'am based upon Frederick n he said that knowledge is power okay that he basically means to say that power is like a narrative it's a discourse that runs through the society like blood does through our capillaries so he says that power cannot be is not a position but it is when people exercise their discourses or their way they communicate similarly ma'am another thinker Hannah ENT was also there who said when people come and and act in concert with each other power is born so it is basically when people just like all our citizens come together they exhibit power so they are the two different connotations okay great my last question to you how much it is possible or is it viable for remote voting if you go for remote voting so is it viable in India is it possible looking into the grassroot level and the rural people around the migrants so is it possible is it viable M can I take a few yes ma'am I feel it is possible uh currently there was a technology introduced by Bale regarding uh remote voting machines where one could vote for 72 constituencies at once so it basically displays how technology can be leveraged to promote this particular concept and I think it is a positive concept because given in the globalized world that we are living migration is an eventuality so this can help this can help people exercise their franchise but at the same time do not leave their economic jobs that they are currently pursuing okay thank you Kunal thank you ma'am Kunal ma'am for how long have you lived in tripura uh ma'am for uh I started my schooling there until class 10 I was there okay I was reading somewhere that uh students in tripura are uh there are increasing cases of AIDS among students in tripura yes ma'am what is going wrong ma'am I feel in that particular place sexual education is missing from the school curriculum and but isn't that missing from entire India uh yes ma'am it is missing but in the rest of India ma'am the protective gears are easily available as compared to in the northeastern regions because of obious logistic issues so that's why the unprotected sex leads to AIDS among the communities particularly the tribal ones okay Kunal what is your idea of feminism you're a student of political science I'm curious to know what you understand by feminism M according to me feminism means allowing or uh a woman is able to achieve whatever she wants to achieve not from the prism of any other people so for example if a uh if a particular female wants to do something with a life she should have the agency as well as the necessary societal support to achieve that but that should does not mean that the male sets its parameters so a woman needs to develop in her own Accords according to her own capacity and according to her own agency without the intervention of external observing that there's this Rising trend of uh women dropping from Workforce in urban areas yes Ma'am why is that happening gal ma'am firstly uh there is an inverted U curve ma'am that basically hypotheses that as woman wom are in the urban areas they are going for higher education instead of Workforce so once they come out of this education the workforce for women would automatically increase secondly ma'am the safety issue is also there whereby women do not feel as protected as they should be and so they drop out thirdly ma'am as the income is rising and the patriarchal tendency is there the the male when they start to have earn enough they tell their uh spouses to stay at home and they do the job so I think these three parameters when acting in confluence who is your best friend my mother you don't have any friend you know apart from your mother I mean somebody of your age who's your friend ma'am I think a friend is someone that you can talk to anything about and I feel most comfortable sharing my intimate things with my mother that's why I feel she's my best friend we call up your mother and we ask her uh some weaknesses of Kunal what do you think she will mention ma'am I think uh my fondness of cooking and eating uh has uh made me a little bit on the heavier side and I think that is one of my weaknesses that I could think about and she will also be don't you feel that cooking for you might be hobby but for so many women in India yes ma'am uh you know it's need of the earthart to feed their family they have to cook it's a burden that they carry isn't that sad uh unfortunately ma'am that is the sad reality because of our patriarchal mindset but yes things are changing and uh with the Democratic families that are being instituted because of liberalization and globalization and economic independence uh things are changing uh I see your hobbies watching science fiction yes ma'am if you had to bring one science fiction to reality which one would you bring Ma I think the one movie that comes to uh mind with regards to application of knowledge Ma I think the uh movie is Avatar that I would like to bring into reality uh simply because in Avatar we have seen that how uh Humanity because of its greed is trying to destroy other worlds but at the same time the when uh natural people when they are co-inhabiting with their nature and environment they are able to bring a more sustainable lifestyle so if we try to not copy the humanity that is shown there and try to imitate the local indigenous people perhaps we would also be able to save our Earth okay my last question to you is U tell this board why should we select you and not other candidates that we have interviewed ma'am I feel that my hard work my sincerity is one aspect that the vat could uh look into but if yes there are other candidates who are better than me then perhaps the vat should be going for them thank you Kunal sir you have some exposure to tripura also and you are student of political science right sir why the left front government ruled tripura for such a long time what was the reason behind it now of course the government has changed but they have a very I mean long history of ruling tripura why so I think for the simple fact that they are CER based parties so when CER based left parties are there they usually rule for a long period of time because people are associated directly with the party and so they do not want to vote for other Alternatives and that's where the left rule is there but once the party changes the CER disseminates and then it is very difficult for left to come again into Power like we saw in West Bengal yeah tell me some of the tribal groups of tripura name just few uh sir the burar there jamat rangs are there haong are there sir breu refugees BR are there right tell us something about the chakar refugee issues so chakar indigenously Buddhist in origin they started their Journey from uh uh Chinese region Myanmar and then when they were persecuted they come to arunachal Pradesh and then they came to India uh Came To tripura Sir so what was the issue uh sir as far as I know it was religious persecution that basically l L them to flee from there sir and you have also shown your interest in Asian geopolitics right sir what is Pivot of Asia policy so the pivot of Asia policy was started by honorable President Barack Obama in 2015 when it decided to uh reorient its attention towards the Asian region because of growing threats from China as compared to its Middle East policy or for that matter its European security architecture yeah and what is the importance of India as one of the major AIS of this pivot of isia policy sir according to the US National Security Doctrine it has followed the island chain strategy whereby India forms a pivotal part in countering China both through the maritime Corridor as well as through the Himalayan Corridor so India basically forms one of the most important pillars there right and why Indian Ocean is uh so important for India from geopolitical and geost strategic point of view so in terms of geopolitics sir uh India has always wanted the Indian region to be free from extra territorial powers like China which could perhaps use that particular region in future for military incursions so strategically speaking the Indian Ocean region hosts more than 90% of the global trade routes the sea lines of communication so uh securing that is vital for India's economic interdependence Independence so these two are the major reasons yes major reasons for India trying to become the net security provider for the Indian Ocean region and your take on the delicate balancing of India in the uh West Asia region between the tripods which is Israel the Saudi Arabia and Iran I mean how India is balancing it do you think is it a fit policy sir the central is the Middle Eastern region is important for India because of its labor force its economy and oil so for Israel point of view sir it has followed the de hyphenated de hyphenation policy whereby it is uh treating israelian own merits because of its agricultural technology and defense for Iran sir because of its chabahar port and its access to central asan region perhap and most importantly Afghanistan and also Iran is a supplier of oil to us for Saudi Arabia sir it India has maintained its posture regarding its uh in uh engagement with the Palestine Israel issue and because of the facts that there a large number of Indian diaspora live and work in Saudi Arabia and UAE where a large amount of remittances also come so it has try to balance these three things so that National interest is secured right and you have also worked as a financial derivative analist for SMC Global yes sir yeah so what was basically your portfolio I mean what kind of portfolio you were managing sir uh I was in uh stock market research sir so my basic job was to analyze a company based upon its ratios and macroeconomic fundamentals so that we can pitch that particular stock to potential investors yeah so right now the stock markets are at at a historic high level sir is it real or is it a bubble sir I think it is real uh given the fact that the uh whole economy according to IMF is facing imminent recession India has become a sweet spot and carrying 16% of the global growth moreover sir because of the liquidity easing in us there is a 1ak 160,000 CR incursion of funds from foreign portfolio investors which basically means that the substant that the foundations of our stock market is very strong and that's why the share market is rising thank you konal sir so Kunal uh in recent times you must have observed that OT platforms have gained a lot of popularity and this is to that extent that it is now surpassing the big screen Productions so what could be the possible reasons for this sudden growth of the OT platforms and their popularity sir the first thing is ease of accessibility because it is a very Democratic uh platform whereby users can easily access it secondly sir the freedom uh the artistic Freedom that is there in the otd platforms which is not the case with movies where the sensor board usually intervenes and third sir is the uh lowbudget films that could be created and posted in the otd platforms which is not the case with the movies because of the distribution Network required since you have mentioned the sensor board can you tell me how these OT platforms are regulated the kind of content that goes on air on an OT platform how this content is regulated sir it is done by Ministry of uh inform information and broadcasting do we have uh some specific guidelines rules or regulations uh yes sir we do Under the it rules 2021 there have been guidelines set for this particular uh OT platforms okay so my next question to you is in the light of the Contemporary developments in the field of artificial intelligence uh what role do you think that AI can play in the domain of geopolitics and international relations So militarily speaking AI is going to control or is on the verge of controlling the battlefields because most of our systems are based upon automated networks be the UAV drones or the missile launching system so politically sir AI has the power to shape the communications and the language in which the politicians uh interact uh economically speaking sir AI uh the companies which are involved in AI production and management are going to be the world leaders just like Google was for its search engine so many economies trying many economies and corporates are trying to leverage this AI for potential production and fourth sir I think a labor issue is going to be a major thing when AI goes into the markets particularly in the Middle East and uh USA where a large Indian diaspora involved in it Technologies are there it may further strain relations between them okay so in AI there is a technology called Deep fake so with regards to the development of this technology what challenges do you see in the terms of international relations and managing the relations between uh the countries so the first thing that comes to mind is misinformation perhaps the defect technology could be used to alter the uh Pro alter and process imaged according to one's liking and then portray a negative image like many cases were also uh emerging out of Russia Ukraine conflict or the isra Palestine War secondly sir uh I think defix would all be could also be utilized to manufacture voice voice impersonations is also a possible uh possibility out of the deep fake so this could be utilized for uh jamming or altering the communications good good can you tell me which edition of the G20 Summit was recently concluded sir the 18th okay and uh what were the key takeaways of this Summit so can I take a few second name any three so inclusion of African Union okay the Indian M uh Indian Middle East economic Corridor and the national biofuel Alliance so now uh G20 will become g21 no uh yes sir uh I'm not sure sir about this fine what is RCC so it is reinforced cement concrete so uh follow up last question how is it different from the normal cement sir it is basically concrete but it is reinforced by Steel so that the tensile strength is improved okay thank you thank you sir have you heard about ganga vas screws yes sir I have what could be the environmental concerns in the cruise sir first is regarding biodiversity where it could uh threaten the inhabitants of the population like the Indian gtic dolphin second sir where uh a large amount of dredging takes place so that the minimum amount of uh minimum submergence that the ship is required is taken and that dredging process could harm the environment uh third sir is regarding the passengers they may be into pollu polluting the uh gantic ecosystems what do you mean by a soft State sir a soft state is one which is not able to imp ment the laws that it has legislated do you think India is a soft State I don't think so sir uh India has able time and again to enforce most of its legal obligations apart from few sectors sir and this is manifested by the peaceful relatively peaceful environment that India has compared to its neighboring boundaries okay and what is a deep state so deep state are the major stakeholders which play behind the screen behind the scene and try to control The Upfront uh obligations and interactions of the government could you give us two examples of deep streate so one is the big corporate entities uh which fund the elections like in US case the super Pacs uh second sir it could be the military of uh Pakistan which plays behind the cards to alter the environment thank you very much your interview is overk should I wait outside thank you sir may I come in sir yes come in sit down thank you sir so this is your uh first interview or second interview second interview second interview when was the first sir 2021 21 22 sir I gave last year last year only no sir I gave to 2021 me 2021 okay how much marks Did you get in the personality test sir 160 sir why such a low marks sir there were few things that I was unsure about perhaps my answers were a bit long and I think I did two blunders there uh one was uh a question was asked regarding my alameter and I was not able to defend it rather I opposed it somehow and second I don't know how much it impacted but I left my mask and shield on the table itself and okay okay this this time hopefully mask and shield will not be required yes sir but two three things I must tell you because you are otherwise a wonderful candidate sir your nonverbal Communications we have problems with that only okay number one lot of hand movement every time you trying to explain both your hands are moving like this sir that has to be CED okay sir no no hand movement and you have to make a very conscious effort to see that there's no hand movement sure not only that on the top of that legs we also moving moving sir right isn't it sir so hand movement legs movement that has to be completely stopped isn't it sir because it gives a very indecent uh this thing impression so all your good work all your good thinking will go slightly in vain if you are not able to control your hand movements and leg movements and then the your sitting posture try to bring both your legs closer as close as possible okay sir don't try to spread out your legs try to bring out uh bring closer so that is one important advice to you sir otherwise your entry was all right you entered entered like a confident person you interacted with us confidently clearly that is is very important you had views on various issues and uh you explained expressed your views again very clearly and confidently those are good things sir taking a CU from your last interview make sure that you don't pass any negative comment on anything sir like you have been working as an educator sir so we didn't because of laity of time we didn't ask questions related to that some questions may be asked there also don't try to give a negative connotation to that right sir whatever work you are doing you should be sowing enjoying that work yes sir and betterment is everybody works for betterment right sir in advancement in careers you're are looking for a better career in life right nobody can stop you from there but don't just to prove your point don't look down upon anything anything right that is very important otherwise baring all these two three things and you are an excellent candidate so thought about it you coming from a police family you said prash Singh judgment prash sing committee was there so judgment I don't know what context you said judgment s the Supreme Court supreme court judgment that understand that he got confused between the two right sir arising out of recommendations and all that so you have to be very careful about choosing the words sir so the problems faced by the police department the problem faced by the public with the police department the it initiatives which have been taken in the police department lot of it initiatives have been taken sir just keep an idea of that because that could be a question of discussion right as because your father happens to be from the Indian Police Service sir you have very hardly any timeable second is your interview right first day right air going so be confident be honest sir that I keep on telling each and every candidate don't compromise on your honesty sir so you are going to be a civil servant and honesty comes with a premium sir so no guest workers work no surises no conjectures you know you know you don't know plainly and flatly said I don't know doesn't matter sir but don't speak based on half knowledge or no knowledge right sir isn't otherwise cooking aadi based Fusion I what kind of questions will be asked very difficult to but these questions are generally asked to see you as a person sir whether you can construct your thoughts you can conjure up your thoughts and ideas constructively or not that is one thing whether under pressure under duress you are able to be on your own sir you don't buckle Under Pressure number three your communication skill is good right number four your thoughts are well balanced sir is not taking any extreme view on anything these are the qualities of a civil servant sir because once you go to the job then you must have seen your father also how difficult it is to manage a job from an Outsiders perspective one doesn't understand what all a civil servant goes through sir so the this very purpose of personality test is that only don't ear on that side just be your natural self your normal self honest forthright speak what you know don't get into any argument yes sir isn't it don't be judgmental and you will be getting good marks no doubt about it okay all the best to you sir a few questions sir uh sir I contact last time uh my eye contact was very uh not very directed so I started to looking at one person and then see the I don't think that is I mean if you ask me personally sir primarily you should be talking to me if I'm talking to you right sir but if it is a long discussion then I can you can give a very fleeting glance but it should not look artificial that you're looking from this side to that side this time when I was speaking absolutely otherwise I have told told you so it was absolutely fine you have must have worked on that but this time it's good so don't worry about that secondly sir my articulation uh did I take last time also I felt that I was too in fact what happens you see now one once or twice if you say sir may take some time all right but it becomes hacken then there's a problem again and again you are asking sir may I take so take a few seconds to collect your thoughts doesn't matter for that you need not seek any permission from anybody just few seconds only it should not be a longer pause from your side sir and then you go ahead once or twice where you think that really you require to think then only otherwise you know everything just you have to conure up your ideas that's it isn't it so any other that I should be keeping in mind sir your dress and all you'll be going in this dress only no sir I will be changing it changing your dress so go in a proper dress shoes shaving it also so go clean shifted and polish shoes and with a smile on face yes sir isn't it I know internally everybody is under pressure you are nervous but you should not get reflected outwardly on your face right sir okay so all the best thank you sir thank you ma'am thank you [Music]
